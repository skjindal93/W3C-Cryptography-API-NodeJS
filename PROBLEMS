1)HMAC function in DJS requires message to be string. W3C Web Cypto API asks it to be ArrayBuffer.
	Work Around: Convert ArrayBuffer to String and pass it to the HMAC function of the DJS.

2)Generate Key in HMAC:
	Otherwise, if the length member of normalizedAlgorithm is non-zero?? Non-Zero or Just Positive.

3)Key interface: Where does the data of key goes?
	Work Around: Introduce a new attribute data in key interface.

4)Generate Key in HMAC:
	Let algorithm be a new HmacKeyAlgorithm.
	Set the name attribute of algorithm to "HMAC".
	--There is no name attribute in HmacKeyAlgorithm

5)How to generate key using length attribute? Use some random function with some use of the length attribute.

6) In sign menthod, do we also have to check whether the algorithm attribute of key is equal to the algorithm passed as an argument? i.e. if key.algorithm == algorithm, (Object comparison)

7) Import Key : HMAC
	Let data be the octet string contained in keyData.
	--keyData is ArrayBuffer. What does it mean by octet string in keyData. Does it means to just convert the ArrayBuffer to String.
